# How to Add the GIMS Startup Poster

## Quick Steps:

1. **Save the poster image** you uploaded as: `gims-startup-poster.jpg`

2. **Place it in the assets folder**: 
   ```
   c:\Users\aryan\gims-main-2\src\assets\gims-startup-poster.jpg
   ```

3. **The carousel is already updated** to include this image as the first slide!

## What's Been Updated:

✅ The `ImageCarousel.tsx` component now includes the GIMS Startup poster as the **first slide**
✅ Added proper title: "GIMS Startup - Centre for Medical Innovation"
✅ Added description highlighting GIMS as a medical innovation hub
✅ Added relevant stats and specs for the startup center
✅ The carousel now has 5 slides total (was 4 before)

## After Adding the Image:

The poster will automatically appear as the first slide in the carousel with:
- **Title**: GIMS Startup
- **Subtitle**: Centre for Medical Innovation
- **Description**: Government Institute of Medical Sciences, Greater Noida
- **Stats**: Startups Supported, Innovations, Funding Facilitated
- **Specs**: Medical Innovation Hub, Startup Incubation, Research Excellence, Healthcare Solutions

The development server is already running, so once you add the image file, it will hot-reload automatically!
